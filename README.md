A program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and then assigns grades, Compute Standard Deviation, Sort Scores, Re-write program Using Array Lists
1. (20 marks) 1.1). Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
Grade is A if score is Ú best - 10 Grade is B if score is Ú best - 20; Grade is C if score is Ú best - 30; Grade is D if score is Ú best - 40; Grade is F otherwise. The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades. Here is a sample run: Enter the number of students: 4 Enter 4 scores: 40 55 70 58 Student 0 score is 40 and grade is C Student 1 score is 55 and grade is B Student 2 score is 70 and grade is A Student 3 score is 58 and grade is B
The maximum number of scores can be entered is 5, and the scores must be stored in the Array data structure.


1.2). computes the standard deviation of the scores in part 1. Here is the mathematical formula for calculating the standard deviation:
Write a test program that displays the mean and standard deviation, as shown in the following sample: scores: 6 3 4 5 2 The mean is 4.0 The standard deviation is 1.58 1.3). sort the “scores” array using the Arrays class defined in java.util package;
Programming specifications: a. You need to implement Five methods that names are findBest(..), findMean(…), find standardDeviation(…), outputResult(…), SortingScores(…) for this program and apply these methods to produce the output.
b. Please add exception handling code to deal with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for all the array manipulations in your program.




2. (25 marks) rewrite the above program using ArrayList data structure. (hint you need to add all the input scores to an ArrayList).



3. (15 marks) create a two dimensional array that stores a student’s course records for this semester and output the student final grade for each course as %. Note: Please use a nested for loop to manipulate this two dimensional array.
Example: Student name: Smith Smith Grade Info:
